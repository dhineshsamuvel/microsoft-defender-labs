# Vulnerability Patch Management & Exposure Remediation  
*(Microsoft Defender Exposure Management + Intune Remediation)*

---

## 1️⃣ Overview

Today I learned how vulnerability management works inside:

- Microsoft Defender Exposure Management
- Microsoft Intune (Endpoint remediation & policy enforcement)

This document explains:

- How vulnerabilities are identified
- How exposure is calculated
- How remediation is executed
- How Intune is used to enforce patch compliance

---

## 2️⃣ What is Exposure Management?

Exposure Management in Microsoft Defender provides:

- Device vulnerability insights
- CVE tracking
- Software weakness detection
- Security recommendations
- Exposure score calculation

It prioritizes remediation based on:

- CVSS Score
- Exploit availability
- Threat intelligence signals
- Business impact

---

## 3️⃣ Vulnerability Detection Flow

### Step 1: Device Onboarding
Devices must be onboarded to:

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Once onboarded:

- Device inventory is scanned
- Installed software is analyzed
- Missing patches are detected

---

### Step 2: CVE Identification

Defender maps:

- Installed software version
- Known CVEs
- Missing security updates

Example:
CVE-2024-XXXXX detected in outdated Chrome version.

---

### Step 3: Exposure Score Calculation

Exposure score increases when:

- Critical vulnerabilities exist
- Public exploit is available
- Device is internet-facing
- No mitigation is applied

---

## 4️⃣ Security Recommendations

Defender provides:

- Patch update instructions
- Software upgrade recommendations
- Configuration fixes

Example recommendation:
"Update Google Chrome to version X.X.X to remediate CVE-2024-XXXXX"

---

## 5️⃣ Remediation via Microsoft Intune

Intune is used to:

- Push updates
- Deploy security patches
- Enforce compliance policies
- Block non-compliant devices

---

### Intune Remediation Methods

1️⃣ Windows Update Rings  
2️⃣ Feature Update Policies  
3️⃣ Endpoint Security Policies  
4️⃣ Compliance Policies  
5️⃣ Device Configuration Profiles  

---

## 6️⃣ Patch Deployment Workflow

1. Identify vulnerability in Defender
2. Review affected devices
3. Create remediation plan
4. Deploy update via Intune
5. Monitor patch installation
6. Verify exposure score reduction

---

## 7️⃣ Allowing Applications via Intune

If application is blocked:

1. Go to Endpoint Security
2. Modify Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) policy
3. Add exclusion rule
4. Assign policy to device group
5. Sync device

---

## 8️⃣ Risk Reduction Strategy

Best Practices:

- Enable automatic patching
- Prioritize critical CVEs
- Monitor exposure score weekly
- Enforce compliance policies
- Use conditional access for non-compliant devices

---

## 9️⃣ Real-World Security Impact

Proper patch management prevents:

- Ransomware attacks
- Privilege escalation
- Remote code execution
- Zero-day exploitation

---

## 🔟 Key Takeaways

- Exposure management identifies weak points.
- Defender provides prioritized remediation guidance.
- Intune enforces patch compliance.
- Continuous monitoring reduces attack surface.

---

## Conclusion

Vulnerability patch management is a core pillar of:

- Endpoint security
- Zero Trust architecture
- Proactive threat prevention

Today’s learning strengthened understanding of:
Exposure scoring → Risk prioritization → Patch enforcement → Compliance monitoring.
